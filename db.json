John Cena plays U.S. President Rick Derringer, a former action movie star with more fans than respect, while Idris Elba is U.K. Prime Minister Sam Clarke, an embattled, former SAS-trained commando. The pair must work together after Air Force One crashes in hostile territory. Despite their characters finding common ground, IMDb pits these stars against one another to prove who knows the most about Big Bad Buddies.",
